   Tests that security relevant (Security == YES) architecture elements can
   only implement other security relevant architecture elements.  The check
   runs on the architecture types that own an implements link
   (real_arc_int_op implements logic_arc_int_op):
   - a security relevant source implementing a security relevant target builds
     without a warning
   - a security relevant source implementing a non-security relevant target
     triggers the graph check warning
   - a non-security relevant source is exempt from the check
