   :fully_verifies_list: tool_req__docs_common_attr_status_invalid[version==1]
   :test_type: requirements_based
   :derivation_technique: requirements_based

   Test that invalid needs are skipped and are not checked



.. Fixtures for the link and graph checks below

.. feat:: Parent feature of the component
   :id: feat__options_inv_parent
   :safety: ASIL_B
   :status: valid
   :security: NO

   Parent feature fixture.

.. comp:: Component satisfying the requirements below
   :id: comp__options_inv_target
   :safety: ASIL_B
   :status: valid
   :security: NO
   :belongs_to: feat__options_inv_parent

   Component fixture.

.. feat_req:: ASIL_B parent requirement
   :id: feat_req__options__asil_parent
   :reqtype: Functional
   :safety: ASIL_B
   :status: valid
   :security: NO
   :valid_from: v1.0

   Valid ASIL_B parent requirement.

.. feat_req:: Invalid ASIL_B parent requirement
   :id: feat_req__options__asil_parent_inv
   :reqtype: Functional
   :safety: ASIL_B
   :status: invalid
   :security: NO
   :valid_from: v1.0

   Invalid ASIL_B parent requirement.


.. comp_req:: Missing safety attribute
   :id: comp_req__options__missing_attr_invalid
   :reqtype: Functional
   :status: invalid
   :security: NO
   :satisfied_by: comp__options_inv_target
   :expect_not: is missing required attribute

   The safety attribute is missing.



.. comp_req:: Security attribute with wrong value
   :id: comp_req__options__bad_pattern_invalid
   :reqtype: Functional
   :safety: QM
   :status: invalid
   :security: MAYBE
   :satisfied_by: comp__options_inv_target
   :expect_not: does not follow pattern

   The security attribute has a value outside the pattern.


.. comp_req:: Derived from a component instead of a feature requirement
   :id: comp_req__options__bad_link_invalid
   :reqtype: Functional
   :safety: ASIL_B
   :status: invalid
   :security: NO
   :satisfied_by: comp__options_inv_target
   :derived_from: comp__options_inv_target
   :expect_not: but it must reference

   The derived_from link points to the wrong need type.


.. comp_req:: The component must start
   :id: comp_req__options__weak_title_invalid
   :reqtype: Functional
   :safety: QM
   :status: invalid
   :security: NO
   :satisfied_by: comp__options_inv_target
   :expect_not: contains a weak word

   The title contains a prohibited word.


.. comp_req:: Id is too long
   :id: comp_req__options__id_exceeds_the_max_length_inv
   :reqtype: Functional
   :safety: QM
   :status: invalid
   :security: NO
   :satisfied_by: comp__options_inv_target
   :expect_not: exceeds the maximum allowed length

   The id is longer than 45 characters.


.. Invalid child: the graph check must not select it.

.. comp_req:: QM requirement derived from an ASIL_B requirement
   :id: comp_req__options__qm_from_asil_invalid
   :reqtype: Functional
   :safety: QM
   :status: invalid
   :security: NO
   :satisfied_by: comp__options_inv_target
   :derived_from: feat_req__options__asil_parent
   :expect_not: QM requirements cannot be derived from ASIL requirements.

   A QM requirement cannot be derived from an ASIL_B requirement.

.. Invalid parent: invalid needs stay part of the graph, so a valid child is still checked against them.

.. comp_req:: QM requirement derived from an invalid ASIL_B requirement
   :id: comp_req__options__qm_from_inv_parent
   :reqtype: Functional
   :safety: QM
   :status: valid
   :security: NO
   :satisfied_by: comp__options_inv_target
   :derived_from: feat_req__options__asil_parent_inv
   :expect: comp_req__options__qm_from_inv_parent: Parent need `feat_req__options__asil_parent_inv` does not fulfill condition `safety == QM`. Explanation: QM requirements cannot be derived from ASIL requirements.

   The parent is invalid, but still visible to the graph check.


.. An invalid need that violates every check above must not produce any warning.
.. Every metamodel warning starts with the need id, so `expect_not` on the id catches all of them.

.. comp_req:: The component shall do everything wrong
   :id: comp_req__options__all_checks_violated_invalid
   :safety: QM
   :status: invalid
   :security: MAYBE
   :satisfied_by: comp__options_inv_target
   :derived_from: comp__options_inv_target, feat_req__options__asil_parent
   :expect_not: comp_req__options__all_checks_violated_invalid
