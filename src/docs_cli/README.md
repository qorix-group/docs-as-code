# Documentation CLI

This package runs local documentation builds and live preview for the targets
created by [`docs()`](../../../docs.bzl). Bazel supplies the source files,
configuration, dependencies and environment for each invocation.

## Commands

Run these targets in the package that calls `docs()`. The examples assume the
workspace root; for a nested package, use a label such as `//component:docs`.

| Command | Action | Result |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `bazel run //:docs` | `incremental` | Build HTML, reusing existing Sphinx output where possible. |
| `bazel run //:docs_check` | `check` | Run the Sphinx `needs` builder. |
| `bazel run //:docs_link_check` | `linkcheck` | Run the Sphinx `linkcheck` builder. |
| `bazel run //:live_preview` | `live_preview` | Rebuild on edits and serve the documentation with sphinx-autobuild. |


## Layout and Bazel integration

- `cli.py` contains the complete implementation: CLI parsing, Sphinx arguments,
  cache checks, bundle watch directories and action dispatch.
- `dirty_build_test.py` covers cache invalidation and mounted watch directories.
- `main_test.py` covers dispatch, build results and the Bazel environment contract.

`_declare_docs_binary()` in `docs.bzl` creates a separate `py_binary` for each
command, using the exported `cli.py` directly as its source. Each binary receives
its own `ACTION`, documentation environment and dependencies from `docs()`.

The `all_sources` filegroup is included by `//src:all_sources` so source-code
linking can traverse this Bazel package boundary.

## Configuration and build state

`docs.bzl` provides `SOURCE_DIRECTORY`, `PACKAGE_DIR`, `DATA`, and optional
configuration such as `SPHINX_CONFIG_FILE`, `SCORE_METAMODEL_YAML`,
`SPHINX_CONFIG_OPTS`, `MOUNTS_MANIFEST`,
`EXTERNAL_NEEDS_FILES`, `TEST_SOURCES` and `KNOWN_GOOD_JSON`.
The sandboxed Needs action passes its external-needs labels separately through
the internal `EXTERNAL_NEEDS_LABELS` variable.
Bazel provides the workspace and runfiles locations. The CLI resolves source
and output paths relative to the package containing the `docs()` call. A
checked-in `conf.py` is resolved from the source tree; configuration-free
targets receive structured Sphinx overrides through `SPHINX_CONFIG_OPTS`. When
no config file is supplied and that option list is non-empty, the CLI selects
Sphinx's configuration-free mode automatically.

All actions share the package's `_build` directory. Before starting, the CLI
removes stale output if the previous build recorded warnings, the stored hash
is missing, or the contents of `MODULE.bazel`, `MODULE.bazel.lock` or the package's
`BUILD` file have changed. Successful non-preview builds record the input hash;
failed builds append a marker to `warnings.txt` to force cleanup next time.

Live preview also watches mounted bundle source directories and generated data
directories outside the main Sphinx source directory, using the same mount
resolver as the Sphinx extension.

## Tests

From the repository root:

```sh
bazel test //src/docs_cli:dirty_build_test //src/docs_cli:main_test
```

To exercise the entry script and its runfiles with an actual Sphinx build:

```sh
bazel run //src/tests/docs_bzl/scenarios/basic_docs:docs
```
