## Development of docs-as-code

### Getting IDE support for docs-as-code development

Create the virtual environment via `bazel run //:ide_support`.
If your IDE does not automatically ask you to activate the newly created environment you can activate it.

- In VSCode via `ctrl+p` => `Select Python Interpreter` then select `.venv_docs/bin/python`
- In the terminal via `. .venv_docs/bin/activate`


### Enabeling pre-commit

Pre-commit is supported inside docs-as-code to help with code quality and make developers workflow easier.

Install the hook:
```bash
pre-commit install

# Or install it to run on pre-push via:
pre-commit install --hook-type pre-push
```

Execute the pre-commit manually via `pre-commit run` or `pre-commit run --all-files` to run it on all files.
