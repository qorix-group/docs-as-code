Inside a folder
=================
This example will help catch things and bugs when rst's are defined inside a folder.

.. stkh_req:: TestTitle
   :id: stkh_req__testing__test_requirement
   :status: valid
   :safety: QM
   :rationale: A simple requirement we need to enable a documentation build
   :reqtype: Functional

   Some content to make sure we also can render this.
   This is a link to an external need inside the 'score' documentation.
   :need:`SCORE_feat_req__persistency__config_file`.
   Note how it starts with the defined prefix but in UPPERCASE. This comes from sphinx-needs, `see here <https://github.com/useblocks/sphinx-needs/blob/master/sphinx_needs/external_needs.py#L119>`_


.. feat_req:: Some Title
   :id: feat_req__testing__some_title
   :reqtype: Process
   :security: YES
   :safety: ASIL_D
   :satisfies: SCORE_stkh_req__overall_goals__reuse_of_app_soft
   :status: invalid

   With this requirement we can check if the removal of the prefix is working correctly.
   It should remove id_prefix (SCORE _) as it's defined inside the BUILD file and remove it before it checks the leftover value
   against the 'allowed' defined regex in the metamodel
