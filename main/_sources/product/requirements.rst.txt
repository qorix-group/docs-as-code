üìà Status
##########

This section provides an overview of current process requirements and their clarification & implementation status.

.. note::
  All open issues and pull requests in the process repository are considered as if they
  are already part of the process requirements. They address a lot of the
  requirements that are referenced in this document, so we would be blocked if we would
  not consider them as part of the process requirements.

üóÇÔ∏è Common Attributes
#####################

.. note::
  To stay consistent with sphinx-needs (the tool behind docs-as-code), we'll use `need`
  for any kind of model element like a requirement, an architecture element or a
  feature description.


----------------------
üî¢ ID
----------------------

.. tool_req:: Enforces need ID uniqueness
  :id: tool_req__docs_common_attr_id

     PROCESS_gd_req__arch__attribute_uid
  :parent_covered: YES: together with tool_req__docs_attr_id_scheme

  Docs-as-Code shall enforce that all Need IDs are globally unique across all included
  documentation instances.

  .. note::
     Within each docs-instance (as managed by sphinx-needs), IDs are guaranteed to be unique.
     When linking across instances, unique prefixes are automatically applied to maintain global uniqueness.

  Docs-as-Code shall enforce that Need IDs follow the following naming scheme:

  * A prefix indicating the need type (e.g. `feature__`)
  * A middle part matching the hierarchical structure of the need:
     * For requirements: a portion of the feature tree or a component acronym
     * For architecture elements: the structural element (e.g. some part of the feature tree, component acronym)
  * Additional descriptive text to ensure human readability
