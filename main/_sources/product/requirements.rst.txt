üóÇÔ∏è Common Attributes
#####################

.. note::
  To stay consistent with sphinx-needs (the tool behind docs-as-code), we'll use `need`
  for any kind of model element like a requirement, an architecture element or a
  feature description.


----------------------
üî¢ ID
----------------------

.. tool_req:: Enforces need ID uniqueness
  :id: tool_req__docs_common_attr_id
  :implemented: YES
  :tags: Common Attributes
  :satisfies:
     PROCESS_gd_req__req__attr_uid,
     PROCESS_gd_req__tool__attr_uid,
     PROCESS_gd_req__arch__attribute_uid
  :parent_has_problem: NO
  :parent_covered: YES: together with tool_req__docs_attr_id_scheme

  Docs-as-Code shall enforce that all Need IDs are globally unique across all included
  documentation instances.

  .. note::
     Within each docs-instance (as managed by sphinx-needs), IDs are guaranteed to be unique.
     When linking across instances, unique prefixes are automatically applied to maintain global uniqueness.

.. tool_req:: Enforces need ID scheme
  :id: tool_req__docs_common_attr_id_scheme
  :implemented: PARTIAL
  :tags: Common Attributes
  :satisfies: PROCESS_gd_req__req__attr_uid, PROCESS_gd_req__arch__attribute_uid
  :parent_has_problem: YES: Parents are not aligned
  :parent_covered: YES: together with tool_req__docs_attr_id

  Docs-as-Code shall enforce that Need IDs follow the following naming scheme:

  .. TODO: is it "indicating" or "perfect match"?
     e.g. workflow -> wf would be ok for "indicating", but not for "perfect match"

  * A prefix indicating the need type (e.g. `feature__`)
  * A middle part indicating the hierarchical structure of the need:
     * For requirements: a portion of the feature tree or a component acronym
     * For architecture elements: the final part of the feature tree
  * Additional descriptive text to ensure human readability


----------------------
üè∑Ô∏è Title
