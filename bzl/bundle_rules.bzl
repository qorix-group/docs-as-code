"""Internal Bazel support for composing reusable documentation bundles."""

# `docs_bundle` models documentation structure at the bundle level. In addition to
# source files, it propagates information such as:

# * where a bundle is mounted, * which document it is attached to, * which document acts
# as its entry point, * which repository owns its sources, * whether it is an internal
# or external bundle, * and how nested
# bundles are rebased when composed.

# It also performs bundle-specific validation and conflict detection. The propagated unit
# is therefore not just a set of files with path transformations, but a structured
# documentation component with composition semantics.

# The provider is consumed directly by the repository-owned Needs action, while
# its entries are consumed by the mounts manifest action. Keeping both consumers
# on this provider ensures that source ownership and runtime placement agree.
