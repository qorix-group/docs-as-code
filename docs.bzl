"""Public Bazel macros for building and composing S-CORE documentation.

The ``docs_bundle`` macro describes which documentation files belong to a
reusable bundle and how nested bundles are composed. Source-bearing bundles
also create a ``<name>.__internal__.needs_local`` export containing Needs from
their own sources. The root bundle created by ``docs()`` follows the same rule;
its existing project-wide ``needs_json`` export remains available as well.
Standalone exports remain self-contained; references to Needs defined outside
the bundle remain unresolved until cross-bundle imports are added. A bundle can
associate itself with a repository's root docs configuration without depending
on the root bundle's composed content.
"""

# Multiple approaches are available to build the same documentation output:
#
# 1. **Esbonio via IDE support (`ide_support` target)**:
#    - Listed first as it offers the least flexibility in implementation.
#    - Designed for live previews and quick iterations when editing documentation.
#    - Integrates with IDEs like VS Code but requires the Esbonio extension.
#    - Requires a virtual environment with consistent dependencies (see 2).
#
# 2. **Directly running Sphinx in the virtual environment**:
#    - As mentioned above, a virtual environment is required for running esbonio.
#    - Therefore, the same environment can be used to run Sphinx directly.
#    - Option 1: Run Sphinx manually via `.venv_docs/bin/python -m sphinx docs _build --jobs auto`.
#    - Option 2: Use the `incremental` target, which simplifies this process.
#    - Usable in CI pipelines to validate the virtual environment used by Esbonio.
#    - Ideal for quickly generating documentation during development.
#
# 3. **Bazel-based build (`docs` target)**:
#    - Runs the documentation build in a Bazel sandbox, ensuring clean, isolated builds.
#    - Less convenient for frequent local edits but ensures build reproducibility.
#
# **Consistency**:
# When modifying Sphinx extensions or configuration, ensure all three methods
# (Esbonio, incremental, and Bazel) work as expected to avoid discrepancies.
#
# For user-facing documentation, refer to `/README.md`.

    Args:
      name: target name.
      source_dir: optional directory holding this bundle's own doc sources. It is
        globbed like `docs()` (same file kinds) and the contents are stored after
        stripping the `source_dir` prefix. Leave it unset for a pure aggregator.
        For a source-bearing bundle this is a package-relative directory name;
        `"."` means the package root. If `srcs` is supplied instead, those
        explicit files determine the Sphinx action's source root. `None` means
        that the bundle has no directory-glob source root.
      srcs: Explicit documentation source files, including generated files.
        Use this for a source-less bundle whose documentation is produced by a
        build action. All files must share one parent directory so they can be
        mounted as one bundle entry.
      data: Files owned by this bundle that are not discovered as documentation
        sources. Use this for runtime/support files that belong at the bundle's
        eventual mount location. ``docs(data = [...])`` is the corresponding
        shorthand for supporting files in the project's root bundle. Both
        forms make their files available to a build; only bundle data travels
        with a mounted bundle.
      entry_doc: bundle-relative docname attached when this bundle is mounted.
        Defaults to `index`.
      bundles: nested bundles to compose, each a dict
        {
            "bundle": <docs_bundle label>,
            "mount_at": <where it shall me mounted>,
            "attach_to": <optional document to attach the bundle to; for a bundle root it defaults to the mount_at parent's index>
        }.
      code_targets: Implementation targets or filegroups to scan for source-code
                    links. Implementation target source files and their dependencies
                    are collected recursively; filegroups expand to their files.
      primary_need_id: Sphinx-Needs ID of the primary Need representing this
                       bundle. Other Needs may remain in the bundle; only this
                       Need receives bundle-level target metadata.
      root_docs_config: Internal provider target for the root bundle's
                         structured ``docs()`` configuration.
      is_root_bundle: Whether this is the project root bundle. Root bundles
                      retain the configured canonical project URL.
                         Public callers provide the corresponding ``root_docs``

                    links. Implementation targets are scanned recursively; filegroups
                    expand to their files.
      primary_need_id: Sphinx-Needs ID of the primary Need representing this
                       documentation project and its root bundle. Other Needs
                       remain unchanged.
      test_sources: Optional list of repo-relative directory paths which will be used to filter testcases for documentation generation.
                    When empty (default), all testcases found in `bazel-testlogs` will be used.
      known_good: Optional label to a "known good" JSON file for source links.
      metamodel: Optional label to a metamodel.yaml file. When set, the extension loads this
                 file instead of the default metamodel shipped with score_metamodel.
      bundles: List of placement dicts describing documentation bundles to overlay
              into this documentation's source tree. Each entry is a dict
                {
                    "bundle": <docs_bundle label>,
                    "mount_at": <where it shall me mounted>,
                    "attach_to": <optional, file where the bundle shall be attached, defaults to the parent section's index>,
                }.
              Note: a bundle label may also point at another module's auto-exposed
              bundle, e.g. "@score_process_description//:docs_bundle".

    ``docs(data = [...])`` owns files in the root ``:docs_bundle``. A child
    bundle uses the same ``data`` attribute and may omit ``source_dir`` when it
    contains only supporting files. Use explicit ``srcs`` in a source-less
    child bundle when its documentation is generated by a build action.
