Requirements
============

This repository provides the docs-as-code tooling used by other SCORE
repositories. The pages in this section therefore focus on two questions:

1. Which process requirements are covered by the docs-as-code tooling?
2. How is the tooling itself verified and qualified for downstream use?

Actual product and module traceability is expected to live in consuming
repositories, such as module repositories and integration repositories that use
docs-as-code as a Bazel dependency.

Pages
-----

- ``tooling_verification`` describes verification evidence for the tooling
  itself, including test results and testcase metadata.
- ``requirement_coverage`` shows per-requirement test and code linkage,
  using the same metrics as CI quality gates.
- ``tool_verification`` is the authoritative Tool Verification Report, including
  the owned use cases, potential malfunctions, qualification evidence and
  lifecycle state.
